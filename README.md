# 24

This is just a simple car game I used to play with my girlfriend back home. You see a car license plate, and yell "can" or "cannot" depending if the numbers can be calulated into the number 24

I'm just making this android representation of the same game, to play together with her long distance.

*current state: basic functionality done, just need to make it multiplayer online
